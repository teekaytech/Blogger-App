# Blog App

This is my very first project with ruby on rails, built together with Samuel. The scope of the project is to understand the basics of Rails, using a Blog App as an example. Project details can be found [here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html#i4:-a-few-gems)

Please Note that you must have github installed on your PC, this can be done [here](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03).


### Prerequisites

Since all the code is written using ruby on rails, `Ruby Runtime >= 1.9` and `rails 6` is required to interpret the code. If you don't have ruby on rails runtime already setup on your computer, follow the instruction for your specific operating system on the [official installation guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails).

### Usage

After cloning on your computer, open the folder using your terminal/command prompt window and run

`rails s`
